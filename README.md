# AnimalNamePicker-CPW212

This is a simple C# .Net Console App for CPW 212. The console welcomes the user to the Animal Name Picker, and prompts them to enter an
animal type and number of animals to be named. The program then randomly selects a number of animal names from the selected type and 
prints them to the console, then asks the user if they would like to go again.
